  Full Stack Web Developer, Graphic Designer, Writer, RPG player and owner of a unique name. This is me: Uthan Hercules! 🐙💜

  I discovered my love for software development by playing ⚔️Final Fantasy 3 as a kid. My mom still says that, after receiving a 🕹️ nintendo on my birthday, I looked at her and said "I want to work with computers and creating games!". Of course, I didn't even know how I was going to do that, let alone what software was, but everything would change when the blogging era arrived and I started studying creating and editing templates with those 💿Web Designer CDs from the 2000s.

  With that name in my head I ended up becoming 🎨Graphic Designer by accident, because I thought they were the ones who created the entire website, but thanks to this accident I met Cubos, who told me about Cubos Academy and made me become a 💻web developer. In addition, I also started 🎮producing games and 📝writing books as a hobby.

  I primarily develop with React and NodeJS, both with TypeScript, but I have already produced with Angular, Vue and Java with Springboot. In both cases, I usually use PostgreSQL or MariaDB as a database. Thanks to my Designer roots, I really enjoy playing around with CSS/SCSS and it's one of the things I find most fun about the Front End!

  I use my design and programming skills like a pencil to draw and write the most diverse solutions and imaginations!
